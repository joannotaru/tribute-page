                    I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspored me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever
                    since
                    the first one. Steve Jobs was
                    a great man and a awesome CEO for apple. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work
                    with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way And make
                    apple
                    greater than
                    before it was. But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man ad I will never forget him. <br>

                    As I heard this sad news via my iphone I am emailing my condolences from my MacBook Pro.
                    Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting.
                    My deepest sympathy to his family and friends. <br>

                    What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly
                    every one that had been published) almost every email I've ever written on machines created by
                    Apple.
                    I interacted online using an apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
                    realize the star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. and through his vision, I have been able to
                    realize
                    my own. you'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work. <br>

                    A part of my heart has cracked. I don't know him personally but I felt like I knew him.
                    I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only
                    imagine his struggles. heaven has certainly gained an angel. <br>
